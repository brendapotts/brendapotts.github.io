This review aims to provide a synopsis of the current management strategies of diabetic foot ulcers, from prevention to the options for treatment. The authors believe that it may be useful to primary care physicians, nurses, podiatrists, diabetologists, and vascular surgeons, as well as all healthcare providers involved in the prevention or management of diabetic foot ulcers.In patients with peripheral diabetic neuropathy, loss of sensation in the feet leads to repetitive minor injuries from internal (calluses, nails, foot deformities) or external causes (shoes, burns, foreign bodies) that are undetected at the time and may consequently lead to foot ulceration. This may be followed by infection of the ulcer, which may ultimately lead to foot amputation, especially in patients with peripheral arterial disease.The physician should also assess skin temperature with the back of the hand. Normal skin temperature ranges from warm at the tibia to cool at the distal toes [20]. Foot-skin temperature can be measured with a handheld infrared thermometer on the plantar aspect of the foot at the level of the first metatarsal head. Elevated temperature is reported to be associated with sudomotor dysfunction and a higher risk for foot ulceration [21, 22].Enzymatic debridement can be achieved using a variety of enzymatic agents, including crab-derived collagenase, collagen from krill, papain, a combination of streptokinase and streptodornase, and dextrans. These are able to remove necrotic tissue without damaging the healthy tissue. Although expensive, enzymatic debridement is indicated for ischemic ulcers because surgical debridement is extremely painful in these cases [31].The results of the subcutaneous administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCFS) in patients with infected foot ulcers vary, with some studies indicating faster resolution of the infection and faster healing [55, 56], while others did not report any significant difference [57, 58]. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is known to be beneficial in the formation of granulation tissue and normal healing [59]; however, one small study failed to prove any significant difference between the intervention and the control group [60]. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) acts on epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells to promote healing [61]. Evidence for the use of EGF in diabetic ulcers is limited, with only a small amount of data reporting a significantly higher rate of ulcer healing with EGF use compared with placebo [62].
