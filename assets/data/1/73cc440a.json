It is also called non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In Type 2, your pancreas makes insulin, but your body does not use it properly. The high blood sugar level often can be controlled by following a diet and/or taking medication, although some patients must take insulin. Type 2 diabetes is particularly prevalent among African Americans, American Indians, Latin Americans and Asian Americans.© 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc., 30 East 33rd Street, New York, NY 10016, 1-800-622-9010.

Diabetes in good control can still lead to skin problems but, in fact, having good glucose control over diabetes can positively affect the quality of the skin and can reduce the incidence of the more severe and difficult-to-control skin problems of diabetes."},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/legs-swelling-causes-and-remedies/","txt":"Diabetic Legs Swelling Causes and Remedies","extract":"Let us look in detail at some leading causes of swelling of legs in diabetes."},{"link":"http://www.practicaldiabetes.com/article/sweating-in-diabetes/","txt":"Sweating in diabetes - Practical DiabetesPractical Diabetes","extract":"Cystic fibrosis affects over 10 000 people in the UK and is recessively inherited. Accumulated thick, sticky mucus impairs lung function and invites infection, causes malabsorption by impairing pancreatic digestive enzyme release, and leads to liver disease. About a third of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes. The median survival of 40 years in cystic fibrosis is reduced by having diabetes.1 Cystic fibrosis increases chloride excretion in sweat – so diagnosis is by sweat testing.2Registration is for health professionals only and gives free access to our content."},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/diabetic-wounds-care-and-healing/","txt":"Diabetic Wounds Care and Healing","extract":""},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/diabetes-itchy-skin/","txt":"Diabetes and Itchy Skin – Skin Care for Diabetic Patients","extract":"The answer to this questions lies in blood vessels and nerves. In diabetics there is poor blood flow to some parts of the skin (high blood glucose damages large and small blood vessels), decreased in sensation (high sugar also damages nerves), and not all parts of the skin are equally moistened. Some parts may sweat more than normal, while other may remain dry. All these factors together decrease the local immunity of skin. Thus small cuts and wounds may remain unnoticed until there is a full-blown infection. Once infected, infection is harder to control in diabetics, due to poor local immunity and blood supply. Thus, itching of the skin is one of the earliest signs that should not be neglected(“Type 2 Diabetes and Skin Health,” n.d.)."},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/diabetes-and-excessive-sweating/","txt":"Diabetes and Excessive Sweating – Likely Causes and Remedies","extract":"Our nervous system controls many functions. It is divided into voluntary and autonomous nervous system. The voluntary nervous system is needed for most of the physical moments,whereas autonomous nervous system as the name says, automatically controls the functioning of various organs.The autonomous system plays a major role in controlling the body temperature. Generalized neuropathy is characteristic of diabetes, which means that our autonomous nervous system loses its efficiency in controlling the body temperature and other functions, or at least the capacity of controlling is diminished to some extent. It often leads to excessive sweating(“Diabetes and abnormal sweating,” n.d.)."},{"link":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0145721706294259","txt":"SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research","extract":""},{"link":"http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/related-skin-conditions","txt":"Diabetes and Your Skin","extract":"Other infections include:\n          Vitiligo: This condition affects your skin color. It's more common with type 1 diabetes. With vitiligo, the cells that make the substance that gives your skin color, melanin, are destroyed.\n          Scleredema diabeticorum: This condition causes a thickening of the skin on the back of the neck and upper back. It's rare, but it can affect people with type 2 diabetes. The treatment is to bring your blood sugar levels under control. Lotions and moisturizers might help soften your skin. "}]}},"context":{}}
