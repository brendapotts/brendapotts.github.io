Excision of necrotic tissue is necessary for wound healing. Calluses or thickened skin surrounding the ulcer need to be excised. Necrotic tissue removed on a regular basis can expedite the rate at which a wound heals and has been shown to increase the probability of attaining full secondary closure[14,15].Oral and parenteral antibiotics are prescribed for mild soft tissue infections and moderate to severe infections, respectively (Table 1)[54]. Evidence-based regimes should be followed for the management of infection in diabetic foot. Appropriate dosage, optimal duration, identification and removal of the infective focus and recognition of adverse effects should be critically evaluated in all outpatients and inpatients with diabetic foot infections[54-56]."},{"link":"https://doi.org/10.2337/dc10-9990","txt":"","extract":""},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/what-is-a1c/","txt":"What is A1c?","extract":"The Hemoglobin A1c level is a good screening test for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  It can’t be used, however, to screen for gestational diabetes or cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.  It can’t be used by anyone who has recently had a blood transfusion or has just developed the disease because it takes three months before the red blood cells to have glucose on the living cells."},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/function-of-insulin/","txt":"Functions of insulin","extract":""},{"link":"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2015/01January/Pages/Inactivity-twice-as-deadly-as-obesity.aspx","txt":"Inactivity 'twice as deadly' as obesity - Health News - NHS Choices","extract":"Researchers wanted to see how many deaths could theoretically be avoided if inactive people became more active, compared to how many would be avoided if obese people lost weight.Studies have linked excessive sitting with being overweight and obese, type 2 diabetes, some types of cancer, and premature death.Physical inactivity kills twice as many as obesity, new study claims.
