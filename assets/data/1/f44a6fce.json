This causes the adrenal glands to put out norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol when exposed to the stressor. The stomach knots up, the respiratory rate is faster, and the heart rate is faster.  The cortisol released by the adrenal cortex (the outer layer of the adrenal gland) causes elevated blood sugar levels in an attempt to provide cellular fuel if the body actually needs to go into fighting or fleeing."},{"link":"http://www.practicaldiabetes.com/article/sweating-in-diabetes/","txt":"Sweating in diabetes - Practical DiabetesPractical Diabetes","extract":"Cystic fibrosis affects over 10 000 people in the UK and is recessively inherited. Accumulated thick, sticky mucus impairs lung function and invites infection, causes malabsorption by impairing pancreatic digestive enzyme release, and leads to liver disease. About a third of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes. The median survival of 40 years in cystic fibrosis is reduced by having diabetes.1 Cystic fibrosis increases chloride excretion in sweat – so diagnosis is by sweat testing.2Registration is for health professionals only and gives free access to our content."},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/are-leg-cramps-caused-by-diabetes/","txt":"Are Leg Cramps Caused by Diabetes?","extract":"There could be many reasons of leg cramps due to diabetes.

This is particularly true for adults. But, as any longtime user of insulin will tell you, such a list does not go far enough in describing how those common symptoms can feel, and it misses some important, albeit not-so-common, symptoms of hypoglycemia.What do you want to read about?"},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/insulin-tolerance-test/","txt":"Insulin Tolerance Test","extract":"The idea behind giving insulin injections is to allow the person to become extremely hypoglycemic (levels lower than 40 mg/dL or 2.2 mmol/l).

The amount of weight gain observed may increase as more intensive insulin treatment programs are utilized. As found in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), patients who were treated with intensive insulin therapy gained 4.75 kg more than patients on conventional therapy (10). In a smaller study, among 14 patients with type 2 diabetes, treated with an intensive insulin program over 6 months, there was an increase in body weight from 93.5 (± 5.8) to 102.2 (± 6.8) kg (P<0.001) (20). Weight gain associated with insulin therapy is believed to be primarily due to the anabolic effects of insulin, an increase in appetite, and reduction of glycosuria (18,21). It has been suggested that actions of the basal insulin analog, insulin detemir, in both the liver and brain, may contribute to the explanation of favorable weight characteristics that have been associated with its use. As insulin detemir is bound to albumin, it has easy access through the hepatic sinusoids, directly into the liver. This might lead to a preferential effect on the liver and relatively reduced effect in the periphery, which more closely approximates physiological insulin action as compared to the other basal insulin formulations, and could cause similar plasma glucose levels with less hypoglycemia and weight gain (25,45). In a study involving mice, insulin detemir was found to act faster and more predominantly in the brain, as measured by an altered pattern of insulin-receptor signalling, as compared with human insulin. This marked activation of insulin signalling in the brain may be involved in preventing overeating and weight gain (46)."}]}},"context":{}}
