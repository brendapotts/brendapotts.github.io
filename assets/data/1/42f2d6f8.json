If you eat too many carbs in any given day, your blood sugar levels may be high.  In the same way, taking medications to lower the glucose level may cause you to have low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia."},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/coenzyme-q10-and-diabetes/","txt":"Coenzyme Q 10: A little Known Supplement That Yields Big Results","extract":""},{"link":"https://doi.org/10.4103/0253-7613.77379","txt":"Metformin allergy Wiwanitkit V - Indian J Pharmacol","extract":""},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/fish-oil-lowers-triglycerides-with-little-or-no-glycemic-effect-in-type-2-diabetics/","txt":"Fish Oil Lowers Triglycerides With Little or No Glycemic Effect in Type 2 Diabetics","extract":"Scientific research has indicated that people who eat a lot of omega 3 fatty acids from eating fish or taking fish oil supplements have a decreased incidence of coronary heart disease. Eskimos, who eat a lot of fish oil in their diet, have decreased triglyceride levels, decreased cholesterol levels, and decreased incidence of heart disease when compared to people who live nearby in Denmark but that eat lesser amounts of fish. Other research has pointed to the fact that people who ate fish at least once weekly had decreased death rates from heart disease than those who didn’t eat fish."},{"link":"https://diabeteslibrary.org/honey-and-diabetes/","txt":"Honey And Diabetes","extract":"Type 1 diabetes involves the production of autoantibodies that act against pancreatic cells that normally produce insulin.  This deficiency in the pancreatic function results in low insulin levels. In type 2 diabetics, the pancreas may be functioning normally but the insulin produced isn’t used well and metabolism suffers.  Rather than using glucose for fuel, the glucose passes through the kidneys and blood sugar will show up in a urinalysis."},{"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0054962/","txt":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Advanced Wound Care Therapies for Non-Healing Diabetic, Venous, and Arterial Ulcers: A Systematic Review - NCBI Bookshelf","extract":"Standard treatment for diabetic ulcers includes debridement of necrotic tissue, infection control, local ulcer care, mechanical off-loading, management of blood glucose levels, and education on foot care. For venous ulcers, standard treatment typically includes the use of mechanical compression and limb elevation to reverse tissue edema and improve venous blood flow. Care for ulcers caused by arterial insufficiency is centered on reestablishing blood flow and minimizing further loss of tissue perfusion.Few studies reported time to ulcer healing and other primary outcomes. We found no benefit in time to ulcer healing for collagen, biological dressings, or silver products. We found mixed but generally negative results for biological skin equivalents (1 of 4 Dermagraft and 1 of 3 Apligraf studies showing benefit compared to standard care), platelet-derived growth factors (4 of 8 studies reporting showing benefit compared to placebo or standard care), platelet-rich plasma (1 of 2 studies showing benefit compared to another advanced therapy), and negative pressure wound therapy (1 of 3 studies showing benefit compared to standard care). Strength of evidence was low or insufficient for all findings related to time to ulcer healing. One study of a silver dressing versus a calcium dressing reported a global outcome of healed or improved ulcers with no difference between groups. No studies reported on return to daily activities.Few studies reported time to ulcer healing. Two studies of the biological skin equivalent Apligraf found shorter time to ulcer healing as did the study comparing a keratinocyte product to standard care. Two other keratinocyte studies reported no significant differences in time to ulcer healing as did a study comparing a silver dressing to a non-silver dressing. Strength of evidence was low for these comparisons. Two studies of silver products reported higher global assessment outcomes in the silver groups; a study of electromagnetic therapy reported no difference between groups. Only studies of electromagnetic therapy reported patient activity levels; one finding no difference between treatment groups and one noting improvements pre- to post-treatment.One good quality study of wounds associated with partial foot amputation (n=162) found that NPWT (compared to standard care) improved wound healing (56% versus 39%, p=0.04) and decreased mean time to healing (56 days versus 77 days, p=0.005). There were significantly more infections in the NPWT group (17% versus 6%, p=0.04), but the incidence of other adverse events did not differ between the NPWT and standard care groups. The effects of ancillary therapies, baseline characteristics, activity level and compliance were not explored.One good quality study of ulcers associated with partial foot amputation showed a benefit of NPWT with respect to healed ulcers and mean time to healing. There were significantly more infections in the NPWT group but the incidence of other adverse events did not differ between the NPWT and standard care groups.Our systematic review of randomized controlled trials found discouragingly low strength evidence regarding the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of advanced wound care therapies for treatment of lower extremity ulcers. This was primarily due to the fact that for each ulcer type (diabetic, venous, or arterial) individual categories of advanced wound care therapies were only evaluated in a few studies, often in highly selected populations, and frequently had conflicting findings. Furthermore, within each category of wound care therapies several different types of interventions were used making it difficult to determine if results were replicable in other studies or generalizable to broader clinical settings. Additionally, most studies compared advanced wound care therapies to standard care or placebo. Therefore there is little comparative effectiveness research evaluating one advanced wound care therapy to another. It has been noted that standard care is an inappropriate comparator for studies of advanced therapy since patients have likely already failed standard care. For arterial ulcers we identified only a single study of any advanced wound care therapy (and this was compared to standard care) despite the clinical importance of arterial ulcers.Furthermore, we did not conduct cost effectiveness analyses or assess additional costs of care associated with chronic ulcers. Despite the high costs of advanced wound care therapies it is possible that they may be cost effective or even cost saving if found to improve ulcer healing; reduce ulcer associated morbidity, hospitalizations, medical care and amputations; and improve functional status and quality of life. Based on our findings from randomized controlled trials the decision of if, when, and in whom to use advanced wound care therapies as well as the type of advanced wound care therapy selected is difficult. Additionally, because little comparative effectiveness research exists to guide choices, decisions may be based on other factors including wound care product cost, ease of use, and patient and provider preferences (the latter also influenced by personal experience with ulcer and patient characteristics).For venous ulcers, we identified only one study of the following advanced wound care therapies: collagen, biological dressings, platelet rich plasma, intermittent pneumatic compression, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. There were no studies of platelet-derived growth factors or typical oxygen. We found no studies that reported on amputations, time to ulcer recurrence, or need for home health care related to the ulcer. One study reported hospitalization, one study reported quality of life, and two studies reported return to work or daily activities.Activity recording is turned off."},{"link":"http://www.practicaldiabetes.com/article/sweating-in-diabetes/","txt":"Sweating in diabetes - Practical DiabetesPractical Diabetes","extract":"Cystic fibrosis affects over 10 000 people in the UK and is recessively inherited. Accumulated thick, sticky mucus impairs lung function and invites infection, causes malabsorption by impairing pancreatic digestive enzyme release, and leads to liver disease. About a third of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes. The median survival of 40 years in cystic fibrosis is reduced by having diabetes.1 Cystic fibrosis increases chloride excretion in sweat – so diagnosis is by sweat testing.2Registration is for health professionals only and gives free access to our content."},{"link":"https://doi.org/10.2337/diaclin.25.3.90","txt":"","extract":""},{"link":"https://www.adwdiabetes.com/articles/4-reasons-for-heavy-sweating-with-diabetes-2","txt":"5 Reasons For Heavy Sweating With Diabetes | ADW Diabetes","extract":"   Notify me by email when the comment gets approved.
